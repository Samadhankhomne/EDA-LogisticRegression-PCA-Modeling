# EDA-LogisticRegression-PCA-Modeling
A comprehensive project applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights from data, followed by building a Logistic Regression model. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction to improve model performance. This repository contains detailed code and visualizations to showcase the complete workflow from data exploration to model evaluation.

Conclusion
In this kernel, I have discussed Principal Component Analysis â€“ the most popular dimensionality reduction technique.
I have demonstrated PCA implementation with Logistic Regression on the adult dataset.
I found the maximum accuracy with the first 12 features and it is found to be 0.8227.
As expected, the number of dimensions required to preserve 90 % of variance is found to be 12.
Finally, I plot the explained variance ratio with number of dimensions. The graph confirms that approximately 90% of variance is explained by the first 12 components.
